# METASPACE

[![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/metaspace2020/metaspace.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/metaspace2020/metaspace) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/sm-distributed/badge/?version=latest)](http://sm-distributed.readthedocs.org/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/metaspace2020/metaspace/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/metaspace2020/metaspace)

[The METASPACE platform](http://metaspace2020.eu/) hosts an engine for
 metabolite annotation of imaging mass spectrometry data as well as a
 spatial metabolite knowledgebase of the metabolites from thousands of
 public datasets provided by the community.

The METASPACE platform is developed by software engineers, data scientists and
 mass spectrometrists from the [Alexandrov team at EMBL](http://www.embl.de/research/units/scb/alexandrov/).
 This work is a part of the [European project METASPACE](http://project.metaspace2020.eu/).

## Projects

| [graphql](metaspace/graphql) | A GraphQL API for accessing the annotations database and metabolite annotation engine |
| [webapp](metaspace/webapp) | A web application for submitting datasets and browsing results |
| [mol-db](metaspace/mol-db) | A service for importing and serving molecular databases |
| [python-client](metaspace/python-client) | A Python library and set of example Jupyter notebooks for performing data analysis on the annotations database |
| [ansible](ansible) | Ansible playbooks for deploying to AWS and Vagrant |
| [docker](docker) | Docker Compose configuration for making development and testing environments |

## Installation
Please check the [ansible](ansible) project for production installations on AWS,
