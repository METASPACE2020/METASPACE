// jasmine-fail-fast should not usually be needed because transaction isolation should prevent cascades of failing tests,
// but this may be useful to keep aroundor make into a config option.

// import * as failFast from 'jasmine-fail-fast';
//
// const jasmineEnv = (jasmine as any).getEnv();
// jasmineEnv.addReporter(failFast.init());
