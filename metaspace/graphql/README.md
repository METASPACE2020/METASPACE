GraphQL interface to SM engine

## Development setup

0. Copy `config.json.template` to `config.json` and edit credentials to match your SM engine installation.
1. `yarn install`
2. `node deref_schema.js ./metadataSchemas/`
3. `yarn run gen-binding` to generate `src/binding.ts`, which contains the TypeScript types for the GraphQL schema.
4. Run `yarn run dev`, it will automatically restart Node.JS server when the code changes.
5. Open `localhost:3010/graphql` in the browser to play with queries.

## Database migrations

Beware that TypeORM doesn't check that the database schema matches its expected structure. 
It's easy to put your database out-of-sync with the migrations on the filesystem by changing branch before reverting,
generating migrations when there have been manual changes, changing migrations after they've run, etc. 
Be careful and follow the below processes when making migrations.

### To make changes to the database schema

0. Run `yarn exec typeorm migration:run` to make sure you are on the latest migration. 
1. Make the changes to the TypeORM entity models.
2. If you are running graphql in any form that automatically reloads on code change (e.g. in the development docker containers),
    stop it so that it doesn't automatically apply the migration.
2. Run `yarn exec typeorm -- migration:generate -n YourMigrationName`.
3. Open the new file in `src/migrations`.
4. Comment out the bugged `SET DEFAULT` lines generated by TypeORM every migration:
    ```
       public async up(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<any> {
           // Always comment these out
           // await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "graphql"."project" ALTER COLUMN "created_dt" SET DEFAULT (now() at time zone 'utc')`);
           // await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "graphql"."coloc_job" ALTER COLUMN "start" SET DEFAULT (now() at time zone 'utc')`);
           // await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "graphql"."coloc_job" ALTER COLUMN "finish" SET DEFAULT (now() at time zone 'utc')`);
       }
   
       public async down(queryRunner: QueryRunner): Promise<any> {
           // Always comment these out
           // await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "graphql"."coloc_job" ALTER COLUMN "finish" SET DEFAULT timezone('utc'`);
           // await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "graphql"."coloc_job" ALTER COLUMN "start" SET DEFAULT timezone('utc'`);
           // await queryRunner.query(`ALTER TABLE "graphql"."project" ALTER COLUMN "created_dt" SET DEFAULT timezone('utc'`);
       }
    ```
   (BUG: https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm/issues/3076 )
5. Run `yarn exec typeorm migration:run` and check that it runs correctly.
6. If it runs without error, but the changes are incorrect, run `yarn exec typeorm migration:revert` to revert 
    the last migration BEFORE attempting to fix the migration file.
7. Make sure to commit the migration file. WebStorm doesn't automatically add it to git - you have to find it in the
    "Unversioned Files" section of the commit window

### To make manual changes to the schema, or changes to the data

0. Run `yarn exec typeorm migration:run` to make sure you are on the latest migration.
1. Run `yarn exec typeorm migration:create` to make a new empty migration file.
 
### In case everything is broken

The following steps can help debugging, if you have made a mistake in a feature branch:

0. Change to the `master` branch.
1. Delete branch-specific tables/columns in the database.
2. Use `yarn exec typeorm migration:show` to show migrations from the current branch, and manually delete any other migrations from the `graphql.migrations` table.
3. Run `yarn exec typeorm migration:run` to ensure you have all migrations from `master` applied.    
4. Run `yarn exec typeorm schema:sync` to re-synchronize the schema.
