# To run containers as a non-root user so that they don't change file permissions,
# append `:docker-compose.uid.yml` to COMPOSE_FILE, and put your user ID
# and group ID here, separated by a colon i.e. `SM_USER=<user id>:<group id>`.
# You can find your user ID and group ID with the `id` command in Linux.
# To fix file permissions after running the containers as root, run:
# `sudo chown -R <your user name>:<your user name> .` in this directory.
